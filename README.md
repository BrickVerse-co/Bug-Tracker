# Bug-Tracker
Welcome to the BrickVerse Bug Tracker! This is your go-to repository for submitting reports on any issues encountered within the BrickVerse platform. Our aim is to provide a swift and efficient channel for you to communicate directly with our development team, ensuring that we promptly address and patch any bugs you may come across.

# How to Report Bugs:
Before submitting a bug report, please ensure it is not listed on the "do-not-report" list. Review the list here to avoid duplication.
To report bugs, create a new issue by following this link [here](do-not-report.md). Make sure to adhere to the template that is automatically filled when generating a new issue.

# Important Note for Security Concerns:
If the bug you've identified poses a vulnerability or is significant enough to be exploited, it is mandatory to keep it as **confidential** and send it to critical@brickverse.gg
