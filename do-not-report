# Excluded Bug Categories
This compilation outlines specific bug categories that, regrettably, will not be addressed by our development team. We appreciate your understanding as we strive to enhance your experience on the platform.

## Browsers Compatibility
Bugs not observed on major browsers such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge will not be addressed.
  
## Mobile Desktop Mode
Bugs stemming from the use of desktop mode on mobile browser apps will not be considered for resolution.

## Issue Consolidation
Please refrain from combining multiple bugs into a single issue unless they are inherently related to one another.

# Previously Resolved Bugs
Bugs that have already been patched or addressed, especially those relevant to the old version of the platform, will not be reopened.

  We encourage users to prioritize reporting bugs that fall outside these excluded categories, ensuring that our efforts are focused on improving the overall functionality and user experience of the platform. Thank you for your cooperation in making the BrickVerse community even better!
